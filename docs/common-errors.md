# Common Errors and How to Fix Them

## Introduction

This guide helps you understand and fix the most common errors that beginners encounter when working with the tic-tac-toe project. Each error includes:

- What the error message means in plain English
- Why the error happens
- How to fix it step by step
- How to prevent it in the future
- Example code showing the problem and solution

Don't worry if you encounter these errors - they're a normal part of learning to program! Every programmer has seen these messages many times.

## Python Syntax Errors

These errors prevent your code from running at all because Python can't understand what you wrote.

### SyntaxError: invalid syntax

**What it means**: Python found something it doesn't understand in your code

**Common causes**:
- Missing colons (`:`) after if statements, while loops, or for loops
- Missing quotes around strings
- Mismatched parentheses or brackets
- Using `=` instead of `==` in conditions

**Example problem**:
```python
if current_player == 'X'  # Missing colon
    print("Player X's turn")
```

**How to fix**:
```python
if current_player == 'X':  # Added colon
    print("Player X's turn")
```

**Prevention tips**:
- Always add `:` after if, while, for, elif, else
- Match every opening `(` with a closing `)`
- Match every opening `[` with a closing `]`
- Use `==` for comparison, `=` for assignment

### IndentationError: expected an indented block

**What it means**: Python expected you to indent code, but you didn't

**Common causes**:
- Forgetting to indent code inside if statements, loops, or try blocks
- Mixing tabs and spaces for indentation
- Not indenting consistently

**Example problem**:
```python
if position >= 1 and position <= 9:
print("Valid position")  # Should be indented
```

**How to fix**:
```python
if position >= 1 and position <= 9:
    print("Valid position")  # Now properly indented
```

**Prevention tips**:
- Always indent code that comes after `:` 
- Use 4 spaces for each level of indentation
- Be consistent - don't mix tabs and spaces
- Most code editors can show you indentation levels

---

### SyntaxError: EOL while scanning string literal

**What it means**: You started a string with a quote but never closed it

**Common causes**:
- Missing closing quote
- Using different quote types (mixing ' and ")
- Trying to put a quote inside a string without escaping it

**Example problem**:
```python
print("Player X's turn)  # Missing closing quote
```

**How to fix**:
```python
print("Player X's turn")  # Added closing quote
# OR
print('Player X\'s turn')  # Escaped the apostrophe
```

**Prevention tips**:
- Always close your quotes
- Use double quotes when your string contains apostrophes
- Use single quotes when your string contains double quotes
- Learn about escape characters (`\"` and `\'`)

## Runtime Errors

These errors happen while your program is running, usually because of unexpected data or conditions.

### IndexError: list index out of range

**What it means**: You tried to access a position in a list that doesn't exist

**Why it happens**: 
- Using position numbers 1-9 instead of 0-8 for list indices
- Calculating row/column incorrectly
- Trying to access beyond the list boundaries

**Example problem**:
```python
board = [['1', '2', '3'], ['4', '5', '6'], ['7', '8', '9']]
position = 5
row = position // 3  # This gives 1 for position 5
col = position % 3   # This gives 2 for position 5
print(board[row][col])  # This works

position = 9
row = position // 3  # This gives 3 for position 9
col = position % 3   # This gives 0 for position 9
print(board[row][col])  # ERROR! Row 3 doesn't exist (only 0, 1, 2)
```

**How to fix**:
```python
board = [['1', '2', '3'], ['4', '5', '6'], ['7', '8', '9']]
position = 9
row = (position - 1) // 3  # Subtract 1 first! This gives 2
col = (position - 1) % 3   # This gives 2
print(board[row][col])     # Now it works! board[2][2] = '9'
```

**Prevention tips**:
- Remember: lists start counting at 0, not 1
- Always subtract 1 when converting from 1-9 positions to 0-8 indices
- Double-check your math for row/column calculations
- Test with all positions 1-9 to make sure your formula works

### KeyError: 10

**What it means**: You tried to access a dictionary key that doesn't exist

**Why it happens**:
- Using invalid position numbers (0, 10, 11, etc.)
- Not validating input before using it as a dictionary key
- Typos in key names

**Example problem**:
```python
board = {1: '1', 2: '2', 3: '3', 4: '4', 5: '5', 6: '6', 7: '7', 8: '8', 9: '9'}
position = 10  # Invalid position
print(board[position])  # ERROR! Key 10 doesn't exist
```

**How to fix**:
```python
board = {1: '1', 2: '2', 3: '3', 4: '4', 5: '5', 6: '6', 7: '7', 8: '8', 9: '9'}
position = 10

# Method 1: Check if key exists first
if position in board:
    print(board[position])
else:
    print("Invalid position")

# Method 2: Use get() with a default value
print(board.get(position, "Invalid"))

# Method 3: Validate input range
if 1 <= position <= 9:
    print(board[position])
else:
    print("Position must be between 1 and 9")
```

**Prevention tips**:
- Always validate input before using it as a dictionary key
- Use `if key in dictionary:` to check if a key exists
- Use `dictionary.get(key, default)` for safe access
- Remember that dictionary keys are case-sensitive

---

### TypeError: list indices must be integers, not str

**What it means**: You tried to use a string as a list index, but lists need integer indices

**Why it happens**:
- Forgetting to convert input() to int()
- Using a string variable where an integer is expected
- Mixing up variable types

**Example problem**:
```python
board = [['1', '2', '3'], ['4', '5', '6'], ['7', '8', '9']]
user_input = input("Enter position: ")  # This is always a string!
position = user_input  # Still a string
row = (position - 1) // 3  # ERROR! Can't do math with strings
```

**How to fix**:
```python
board = [['1', '2', '3'], ['4', '5', '6'], ['7', '8', '9']]
user_input = input("Enter position: ")
position = int(user_input)  # Convert to integer
row = (position - 1) // 3  # Now this works
col = (position - 1) % 3
print(board[row][col])
```

**Prevention tips**:
- Always convert input() to int() when you need numbers
- Use try/except to handle conversion errors
- Be aware that input() always returns a string
- Check variable types when debugging: `print(type(variable))`

### ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'abc'

**What it means**: You tried to convert something to an integer, but it's not a valid number

**Why it happens**:
- User entered letters instead of numbers
- User entered special characters or symbols
- Trying to convert empty strings or spaces

**Example problem**:
```python
user_input = input("Enter position: ")  # User types "abc"
position = int(user_input)  # ERROR! Can't convert "abc" to integer
```

**How to fix**:
```python
user_input = input("Enter position: ")
try:
    position = int(user_input)
    # Continue with valid number
except ValueError:
    print("Please enter a number, not letters or symbols")
    # Ask for input again or handle the error
```

**Prevention tips**:
- Always use try/except when converting user input
- Give clear instructions about what input is expected
- Provide helpful error messages
- Consider allowing users to try again after an error

## Logic Errors

These are the trickiest errors because your code runs without crashing, but it doesn't do what you expect.

### Game Doesn't End When Someone Wins

**What it means**: The win detection logic isn't working correctly

**Common causes**:
- Checking for wins before updating the board
- Wrong win condition logic
- Not setting `game_over = True` when a win is found
- Checking against the wrong values

**Example problem**:
```python
# Checking for wins BEFORE placing the move
if board[1] == board[2] == board[3]:  # Check win
    winner = board[1]
    game_over = True

board[position] = current_player  # Place move AFTER checking
```

**How to fix**:
```python
board[position] = current_player  # Place move FIRST

# THEN check for wins
if board[1] == board[2] == board[3] and board[1] in ['X', 'O']:
    winner = board[1]
    game_over = True
```

**Prevention tips**:
- Always update the board before checking for wins
- Make sure you're checking the right positions
- Include `and board[position] in ['X', 'O']` to avoid false wins with numbers
- Test all possible win conditions

### Players Don't Switch Turns

**What it means**: The same player keeps going, or the wrong player goes next

**Common causes**:
- Forgetting to switch `current_player`
- Switching players at the wrong time
- Switching players even when the game is over

**Example problem**:
```python
# Missing player switch
board[position] = current_player
# Game continues but current_player never changes
```

**How to fix**:
```python
board[position] = current_player

# Check for wins first
if check_for_win():
    game_over = True
else:
    # Only switch players if game continues
    if current_player == 'X':
        current_player = 'O'
    else:
        current_player = 'X'
```

**Prevention tips**:
- Always switch players after a valid move
- Don't switch players if the game is over
- Test that both players get turns
- Use clear variable names to track whose turn it is

---

### Game Accepts Invalid Moves

**What it means**: Players can place moves on occupied positions or outside the board

**Common causes**:
- Not checking if a position is already taken
- Not validating input range
- Checking conditions in the wrong order

**Example problem**:
```python
position = int(input("Enter position: "))
# No validation - accepts any number!
board[position] = current_player
```

**How to fix**:
```python
position = int(input("Enter position: "))

# Validate range
if position < 1 or position > 9:
    print("Position must be between 1 and 9")
    continue

# Check if position is empty (for dictionary version)
if board[position] in ['X', 'O']:
    print("Position already taken")
    continue

# Now it's safe to make the move
board[position] = current_player
```

**Prevention tips**:
- Always validate input before using it
- Check multiple conditions: range, availability, format
- Give specific error messages for each type of problem
- Test with invalid inputs to make sure they're rejected

## Debugging Strategies

### Step 1: Read the Error Message Carefully

Error messages tell you exactly what went wrong and where. Look for:
- The error type (SyntaxError, IndexError, etc.)
- The line number where the error occurred
- A description of what Python expected vs. what it found

### Step 2: Use Print Statements for Debugging

Add temporary print statements to see what's happening:

```python
print(f"Current player: {current_player}")
print(f"Position entered: {position}")
print(f"Board state: {board}")
print(f"Game over: {game_over}")
```

### Step 3: Test with Simple Cases

Start with the easiest scenario:
- Test with valid inputs first
- Try one move at a time
- Use positions you know should work

### Step 4: Check Your Variables

Make sure variables contain what you think they do:
```python
print(f"Type of position: {type(position)}")
print(f"Value of position: {position}")
```

### Step 5: Trace Through Your Logic

Walk through your code step by step:
1. What should happen?
2. What actually happens?
3. Where do they differ?

## Getting Help

### Before Asking for Help

1. **Read the error message** - it usually tells you what's wrong
2. **Check the line number** - the error shows you where to look
3. **Try the simple fixes** - often it's a missing colon or quote
4. **Look at similar code** - find a working example and compare

### When Asking for Help

Include this information:
1. **What you're trying to do** - your goal
2. **What you expected** - what should happen
3. **What actually happened** - the error or wrong behavior
4. **The error message** - copy it exactly
5. **Your code** - the relevant part that's not working
