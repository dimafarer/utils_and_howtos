Tic-Tac-Toe Game Launcher - Educational Menu System

This file provides a menu system that allows students to choose between
two different implementations of tic-tac-toe: one using nested lists
and one using dictionaries. This demonstrates how the same problem
can be solved using different data structures.

Educational Focus:
This launcher helps students understand the learning objectives of each
version and encourages them to try both approaches for comparison.
