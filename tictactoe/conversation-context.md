# Conversation Context - Tic-Tac-Toe Educational Demo

## Project Status
- **Phase**: Design approved, ready for implementation plan (tasks.md)
- **Location**: /home/wsluser/projects/tictactoe
- **Spec files created**: requirements.md and design.md completed

## Key Decisions Made
1. **Hybrid approach**: Both nested lists and dictionary implementations
2. **Educational focus**: Extensive comments for week 3 Python learners
3. **No functions/classes**: Basic constructs only (loops, variables, conditionals)
4. **Visual representation**: ASCII art grid showing positions 1-9
5. **Documentation**: README, concept guides, diagrams, exercises

## Next Steps
1. User will remount Kiro to tictactoe project directory
2. Continue with creating tasks.md (implementation plan)
3. Begin implementation after tasks approval

## Implementation Structure Agreed Upon
- `tictactoe_lists.py` - nested lists version
- `tictactoe_dict.py` - dictionary version  
- `main.py` - game launcher with menu
- `docs/` - educational documentation
- Identical gameplay and visual output for both versions
