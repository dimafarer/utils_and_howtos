# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project creates an educational tic-tac-toe game demonstration for week 3 Python learners. The game will showcase two different data structure approaches (nested lists and dictionaries) to solve the same problem, with extensive documentation and comments to help beginners understand fundamental Python concepts including variables, loops, conditionals, and data structures. The implementation will avoid functions and classes to focus on basic programming constructs.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Python instructor, I want a tic-tac-toe game that demonstrates nested lists, so that students can understand 2D data structures and indexing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game starts THEN the system SHALL display a 3x3 grid using nested lists as the underlying data structure
2. WHEN a player makes a move THEN the system SHALL update the nested list using row and column indices
3. WHEN displaying the board THEN the system SHALL iterate through the nested list structure to show current game state
4. WHEN checking for wins THEN the system SHALL use nested loops to examine rows, columns, and diagonals

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a Python instructor, I want a tic-tac-toe game that demonstrates dictionaries, so that students can understand key-value pairs and dictionary operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game starts THEN the system SHALL display a 3x3 grid using a dictionary with numbered keys (1-9) as the underlying data structure
2. WHEN a player makes a move THEN the system SHALL update the dictionary using numeric keys
3. WHEN displaying the board THEN the system SHALL iterate through dictionary items to show current game state
4. WHEN checking for wins THEN the system SHALL use dictionary key access to examine winning combinations

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a beginning Python student, I want extensive code comments and documentation, so that I can understand every line of code and learn fundamental concepts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the code THEN every variable SHALL have a comment explaining its purpose and data type
2. WHEN viewing the code THEN every loop SHALL have comments explaining what it does and how it works
3. WHEN viewing the code THEN every conditional statement SHALL have comments explaining the logic
4. WHEN viewing the code THEN complex operations SHALL be broken down with step-by-step comments
5. WHEN viewing the project THEN external documentation SHALL explain Python concepts used in the game

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a Python student, I want clear visual representation of the game board, so that I can easily understand the current game state.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the board is displayed THEN the system SHALL show a clear 3x3 grid with borders
2. WHEN positions are empty THEN the system SHALL display position numbers (1-9) to guide player input
3. WHEN positions are occupied THEN the system SHALL display X or O symbols clearly
4. WHEN the board updates THEN the system SHALL clear previous output and show the updated state

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a player, I want to play a complete tic-tac-toe game with two players, so that I can experience the full game mechanics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game starts THEN the system SHALL prompt for Player 1 (X) to make the first move
2. WHEN a player makes a valid move THEN the system SHALL alternate to the other player
3. WHEN a player enters invalid input THEN the system SHALL display an error message and prompt again
4. WHEN a player wins THEN the system SHALL display the winner and end the game
5. WHEN the board is full with no winner THEN the system SHALL display a tie message and end the game
6. WHEN the game ends THEN the system SHALL ask if players want to play again

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a Python instructor, I want comprehensive educational documentation, so that students can learn Python concepts beyond just the game code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN students access the project THEN there SHALL be a README explaining the educational objectives
2. WHEN students need reference THEN there SHALL be documentation explaining lists vs dictionaries
3. WHEN students need help THEN there SHALL be diagrams showing data structure representations
4. WHEN students want to experiment THEN there SHALL be suggested modifications and exercises
5. WHEN students need debugging help THEN there SHALL be common error explanations and solutions

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a Python student, I want to see both implementations side by side, so that I can compare different approaches to the same problem.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running the program THEN the system SHALL offer a choice between list-based and dictionary-based versions
2. WHEN comparing implementations THEN both versions SHALL produce identical visual output
3. WHEN examining code THEN both versions SHALL be clearly separated and labeled
4. WHEN learning THEN comments SHALL highlight the differences between the two approaches
