Every Python file should start with:

```python
"""
Tic-Tac-Toe Game - List Version

This file demonstrates how to create a tic-tac-toe game using nested lists
to represent the game board. This version is designed for week 3 Python
learners who are just learning about lists, loops, and conditionals.

Key concepts demonstrated:
- Nested lists (lists inside lists)
- For loops with range()
- Nested for loops
- List indexing with [row][column]
- Input validation with try/except

```

#### Section Documentation
Use clear section headers throughout the code:

```python
# ============================================
# SECTION: GAME SETUP AND INITIALIZATION
# ============================================
# This section sets up all the variables we need for the game
# We create the board and set the starting conditions

# ============================================
# SECTION: BOARD DISPLAY FUNCTIONS
# ============================================
# This section contains code to show the current game board
# It formats the board nicely so players can see the game state

# ============================================
# SECTION: INPUT VALIDATION AND PROCESSING
# ============================================
# This section handles getting input from players
# It checks if the input is valid and converts it to the right format
```

#### Variable Documentation
Every variable needs explanation:

```python
# board: This is a list that contains 3 other lists (nested list)
# Each inner list represents one row of the tic-tac-toe board
# The values start as strings '1' through '9' to show position numbers
# When players make moves, we replace these with 'X' or 'O'
board = [
    ['1', '2', '3'],  # Top row: positions 1, 2, 3
    ['4', '5', '6'],  # Middle row: positions 4, 5, 6  
    ['7', '8', '9']   # Bottom row: positions 7, 8, 9
]

# current_player: A string that holds either 'X' or 'O'
# This tells us whose turn it is to play
# We start with 'X' because X always goes first in tic-tac-toe
current_player = 'X'

# game_over: A boolean (True or False) that tracks if the game has ended
# We start with False because the game just began
# This becomes True when someone wins or the board is full (tie)
game_over = False
```

#### Loop Documentation
Explain what each loop does and how it works:

```python
# This loop goes through each row in our board
# range(3) gives us 0, 1, 2 - the three row numbers
# We use 'i' as our row number variable
for i in range(3):
    
    # This inner loop goes through each column in the current row
    # range(3) gives us 0, 1, 2 - the three column numbers  
    # We use 'j' as our column number variable
    for j in range(3):
        
        # board[i][j] means: go to row i, then column j
        # For example: board[0][1] is row 0, column 1 (position 2)
        print(board[i][j], end=' | ')
    
    # After printing all columns in this row, start a new line
    print()  # This creates a line break
```

#### Conditional Documentation
Explain the logic behind each condition:

```python
# Check if the current position already has an X or O
# We do this by seeing if the value is NOT a number
# If it's 'X' or 'O', then the position is taken
# If it's still '1', '2', '3', etc., then it's empty
if board[row][col] != str(position):
    # This means the position is already taken
    print(f"Position {position} is already taken by {board[row][col]}")
    valid_move = False
else:
    # This means the position is empty and we can use it
    valid_move = True
```

## Educational Documentation

### Concept Explanations
Create separate documentation files for key concepts:

#### `docs/python-concepts.md`
```markdown
# Python Concepts Used in This Project

## Variables
Variables are like labeled boxes that store information...

## Lists
Lists are collections of items in a specific order...

## Nested Lists
A nested list is a list that contains other lists...

## Loops
Loops let us repeat code multiple times...

## Conditionals
Conditionals let us make decisions in our code...
```

#### `docs/data-structures-guide.md`
```markdown
# Lists vs Dictionaries: Two Ways to Store Game Data

## What is a List?
A list is an ordered collection...

## What is a Dictionary?
A dictionary stores key-value pairs...

## Comparing the Approaches
When we use lists for our tic-tac-toe board...
When we use dictionaries for our tic-tac-toe board...

## Visual Comparison
[Include diagrams showing both approaches]
```

### Exercise Documentation
Provide clear exercises and extensions:

```markdown
# Exercises and Extensions

## Beginner Exercises
1. **Change the Starting Player**: Modify the code so that 'O' goes first instead of 'X'
   - Hint: Look for where `current_player` is first set
   - Try changing it from 'X' to 'O'

2. **Add a Move Counter**: Keep track of how many moves have been made
   - Create a new variable called `move_count`
   - Start it at 0
   - Add 1 to it each time a player makes a valid move

## Intermediate Exercises
1. **Improve Error Messages**: Make the error messages more helpful
2. **Add Input Validation**: Check for more types of invalid input

## Advanced Extensions
1. **Add a Computer Player**: Make the computer play against the human
2. **Create a Tournament**: Keep track of wins across multiple games
```

## Error Documentation

### Common Mistakes Guide
Document typical beginner errors:

```markdown
# Common Mistakes and How to Fix Them

## IndexError: list index out of range
**What it means**: You're trying to access a position in a list that doesn't exist

**Common cause**: Using 1-9 instead of 0-8 for list positions

**How to fix**: Remember that lists start counting at 0, not 1

## TypeError: list indices must be integers, not str
**What it means**: You're trying to use a string as a list position

**Common cause**: Forgetting to convert input() to int()

**How to fix**: Use int(input()) instead of just input()
```

### Debugging Guide
Provide step-by-step debugging help:

```markdown
# How to Debug Your Code

## Step 1: Read the Error Message
The error message tells you what went wrong and where...

## Step 2: Check Your Variables
Add print statements to see what your variables contain...

## Step 3: Trace Through Your Logic
Follow your code line by line...
```

## Visual Documentation

### Diagrams and Examples
Include visual aids to help understanding:

```markdown
# Visual Guide to Nested Lists

## How the Board List Works
```
board = [
    ['1', '2', '3'],  ← This is board[0] (first row)
    ['4', '5', '6'],  ← This is board[1] (second row)
    ['7', '8', '9']   ← This is board[2] (third row)
]
```

## Accessing Individual Positions
- board[0][0] = '1' (top-left)
- board[0][1] = '2' (top-middle)  
- board[1][1] = '5' (center)
- board[2][2] = '9' (bottom-right)
```
