# Additional LangChain Assessment Questions

## LangChain Fundamentals

Q1. What is the primary purpose of LangChain's BaseOutputParser?

A) To convert text into specific data structures  
B) To validate input prompts  
C) To manage memory contexts  
D) To handle API authentication  

</br></br></br></br>
Correct Answer: A) To convert text into specific data structures. BaseOutputParser is designed to transform LLM outputs into structured formats like JSON, lists, or custom objects.

Q2. Which pattern is NOT commonly used in LangChain applications?

A) LCEL (LangChain Expression Language)  
B) MapReduce chain  
C) Microservices architecture  
D) Sequential chain  

</br></br></br></br>
Correct Answer: C) Microservices architecture. While LangChain can be used within microservices, it's not a pattern specific to LangChain applications.

## Architecture & Components

Q3. Which component should you use when implementing a conversation that needs to remember previous interactions but only for a specific number of turns?

A) BufferWindowMemory  
B) ConversationBufferMemory  
C) VectorStoreMemory  
D) EntityMemory  

</br></br></br></br>
Correct Answer: A) BufferWindowMemory. This component maintains a sliding window of the most recent k interactions.

Q4. In LangChain's LCEL (LangChain Expression Language), what does the | operator represent?

A) Conditional branching  
B) Parallel processing  
C) Sequential operations  
D) Alternative options  

</br></br></br></br>
Correct Answer: C) Sequential operations. The | operator chains components together in sequence.

## AI Development Lifecycle

Q5. When implementing a RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) pattern, what should be done FIRST?

A) Configure the LLM  
B) Create document embeddings  
C) Set up the vector store  
D) Define the prompt template  

</br></br></br></br>
Correct Answer: B) Create document embeddings. Document embeddings must be created before they can be stored and retrieved.

Q6. What is the recommended approach for handling rate limiting when working with external LLM APIs in LangChain?

A) Implement exponential backoff  
B) Use multiple API keys  
C) Cache responses  
D) Reduce batch size  

</br></br></br></br>
Correct Answer: A) Implement exponential backoff. This helps manage API rate limits while maintaining application reliability.

## LangChain Features & Limitations

Q7. Which feature is NOT available in LangChain's streaming functionality?

A) Token-by-token processing  
B) Real-time error correction  
C) Partial response handling  
D) Callback management  

</br></br></br></br>
Correct Answer: B) Real-time error correction. LangChain's streaming capabilities don't include automatic error correction.

Q8. What is the primary limitation when using LangChain with custom models?

A) Limited memory options
B) Reduced streaming capability
C) Custom interface requirements
D) No vector store support

</br></br></br></br>
Correct Answer: C) Custom interface requirements. Custom models must implement specific interfaces to work with LangChain.
5. LangChain Components Usage

Q9. Which component type should you use when you need to maintain conversation state across multiple sessions?

A) BufferMemory  
B) PersistentMemory  
C) ConversationSummaryMemory  
D) TokenWindowMemory  

</br></br></br></br>
Correct Answer: B) PersistentMemory. This component type allows for state persistence across sessions.

Q10. When implementing a custom tool in LangChain, which method must be defined?

A) _run  
B) execute  
C) process  
D) invoke  

</br></br></br></br>
Correct Answer: A) _run. The *_run* method is required for custom tool implementation.
6. Python Implementation

Q11. What is the correct way to implement custom exception handling in a LangChain chain?

A) Try-except block  
B) Custom callbacks  
C) Error handlers  
D) Exception middleware  

</br></br></br></br>
Correct Answer: B) Custom callbacks. Callbacks provide the proper way to handle exceptions in LangChain.

## AWS Integration

Q13. Which AWS service should you use with LangChain for semantic search capabilities?

A) Amazon Elasticsearch
B) Amazon CloudSearch
C) Amazon OpenSearch
D) Amazon Kendra

</br></br></br></br>
Correct Answer: C) Amazon OpenSearch. OpenSearch provides the best integration for semantic search in LangChain.

Q14. When implementing document loading from S3 in LangChain, which parameter is NOT required?

A) bucket_name
B) region_name
C) aws_access_key
D) object_key

</br></br></br></br>
Correct Answer: C) aws_access_key. AWS credentials can be provided through environment variables or IAM roles.

Q15. How should you handle concurrent requests when using LangChain with AWS Lambda?

A) Use connection pooling
B) Implement async handlers
C) Enable auto-scaling
D) Create separate instances

</br></br></br></br>
Correct Answer: B) Implement async handlers. Async handlers provide the most efficient way to handle concurrent requests.
