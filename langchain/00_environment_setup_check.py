Environment Setup Checker for LangChain + AWS Bedrock

This is the FIRST file you should run before starting the LangChain examples.
It checks that your computer has everything needed to run AI chatbots with AWS.

What this file checks:
1. Python version (needs 3.8 or higher)
2. Required Python packages are installed
3. AWS credentials are configured
4. AWS Bedrock access is working

Run this with: python 00_environment_setup.py
